# Reading Code
How to gain comprehension of large programs that are not your own, or which you have not touched in a long time.

### From transaction code
If you have a transaction code, but not the name of the actual program, you can enter the transaction code in SE93 (Transaction Code Maintenance). This will uncover the program name. You can then open the program in SE38.

### Object list
In SE38, Ctrl+Shift+F5 shows the list of objects inside and associated with the program. They are automatically sorted into dictionary structures, types, fields, subroutines (forms), and so on.

### Finding a specific element
Ctrl+F is the basic search function in SE38.
