### Tips and tricks

* Performance assistant can be used to find the table behind a list of values such as search help

* If you know someone has worked on the same objects, check their transports (SE9)

* If you are looking for a method or module, check the call stack

* Do not forget to check the Local tab when debugging, to find the in and out parametres of a method

* Use the * symbol when using search help, and try the most likely words that may be associated with the object you are looking for

* SE11 (ABAP dictionary) allows you to look through a slew of objects

* SE80 allows you to look through all objects in the solution

* ST12 allows you to trace a program, as long as you have the correct authorisation

* RPR_ABAP_SOURCE_SCAN is a program that allows you to search the entire source code of your solution
