## Classes
Classes are a collection of public and private methods that can be called from elsewhere in the code. Unlike Function Modules, they must be called within SAP, while a Function Module can be called from anywhere.

### Superclasses
A class does not need a superclass. A class will inherit all the public and protected methods of its superclass (equivalent to parent class in other languages).

### Interfaces
Interfaces are method signatures that work as a blueprint for what the class must implement. It is primarily used for implementing a specific SAP standard interface, for specific design patterns, or for allowing the same method to be called on multiple, distinct classes.
